# Kiva_Codecademy_Project
Data visualizations of loans awarded in developing countries by micro-financing company Kiva

This project aims to convey the ability of different plot types (in this case, created using Seaborn) to prompt different insights.  It utilises a dataset on loans awarded by Kiva to 5 developing countries and the visualizations are showcased, explained and analysed in the PowerPoint presentation.

This repositry contains the following files:
- Jupyter Notebook and Python files of my code used to create the visualizations
- Png images of the data visualizations
- PowerPoint presentation
